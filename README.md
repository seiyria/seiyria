Hey there!

## About Me
- 👋 I'm Kyle, and I'm an open source enthusiast. I love making cool stuff but even more so when I can share it with the world.
- 🔭 In the past, I've worked on some interesting, big game projects [IdleLands](https://github.com/idlelands/idlelands) and [Land of the Rair](https://github.com/landoftherair/landoftherair).
- 🎲 I love playing board games and like to make software to make board games more fun!
- 🎁 Want to support my creations? Check me out on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/seiyria) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/seiyria)!

## Professional Activity
